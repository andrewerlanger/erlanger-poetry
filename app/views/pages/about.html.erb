      <div class="text-half">
        <p>Having retired from the teaching profession after thirty years of instructing middle school students in French, Mathematics and English, I've now found extra time to devote to my life-long passion of poetry writing.</p>

        <p>Since early childhood when I was introduced to A.A Milne’ poetry, I have always been drawn to rhyming and rhythmic verse – and I still gravitate towards this genre in my own writing. A prolific poet during my primary school years, I have continued to find poetry an excellent medium for recording the observations, particular moments and feelings experienced in the course of our everyday lives.</p>

        <p class="final-paragraph">Although I have written poems on a diverse range of themes, the bulk of my creative energy finds an outlet in the hundreds of poems I have written through the eyes of a child.  Given that childhood is such a short and precious phase in the human life cycle, I feel drawn to immortalising the ups and downs of being a child in a way that can be easily and fondly remembered.</p>
